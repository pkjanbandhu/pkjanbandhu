## Hi there, I am PK Janbandhu! 👋

I am IT professional from India with over 23+ years of industry experience. My technology specialization and interests include biometrics, cryptography, PKI, MFA, networking, AI, web and mobile applications, cloud and data security. I have authored 5 research papers in 2001 on biometrics based key generation for cryptography based digital signature algorithms (RSA and DSA) known as "Biometric Signatures" during my Master program at NTU Singapore including an "Information Management & Computer Security" journal paper (UK) and 2 IEEE conferences. Presented Biometric Signatures implementation speeds in JAVA in my publications. My research on biometric signatures is one of the pioneering works in the field of biometric cryptosystems and is also the basis for today's passwordless authentication protocols like FIDO which is market worth billions of dollars and is used by companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft in their products for passkeys. It has been cited in over 120 publications including 10 USA patents. My B-Tech final year project on embedded networking on design of microcontroller based standalone and bi-directional parallel to serial port network adapter (for interfacing computers and peripherals having SPP/EPP and Centronix printer port with devices having RS-232) and associated software in C and 8751 assembly languages implemented during 1998-99 at IIT Bombay is published in Dr Dobb’s Journal (one of the best Silicon Valley, USA based software magazines of its time). I am AWS certified cloud solutions architect and security specialist. Presently, I am working as Senior Security Architect with a leading IT company in India.

Below are some of my work on biometrics, PKI and embedded networking:

1. [Passwordless authentication using Biometric Signatures and FIDO](https://biometricsignatures.blogspot.com/)
2. [Novel biometric digital signatures for Internet‐based applications](https://www.emerald.com/ics/article-abstract/9/5/205/180760/Novel-biometric-digital-signatures-for-Internet?redirectedFrom=fulltext)
3. [Modified Private Key Generation for Biometric Signatures](https://wseas.us/e-library/conferences/malta2001/papers/256.pdf)
4. [Dr Dobb's Journal article on Parallel to Serial Port Adapter](https://www.drdobbs.com/embedded-systems/designing-a-parallel-to-serial-port-adap/223100564)
