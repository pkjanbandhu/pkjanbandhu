## Hi there, I am PK Janbandhu! ðŸ‘‹

I am IT professional from India with over 23+ years of industry experience. I received my Bachelor of Technology degree in Electrical Engineering from IIT, Bombay in 1999 and Master of Engineering degree by research in IT Security from School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, NTU, Singapore in 2002. I have held leadership positions in both software product as well as IT consultancy companies for International clients from USA, Canada, UK, Europe and Japan in various domains like Finance, Telecom, Semiconductor, Manufacturing, Oil and Gas. My technology specialization and interests include biometrics, cryptography, PKI, MFA, networking, AI, web and mobile applications, cloud and data security. I have successfully lead past companies to qualify got US Governments's JITC and Common Criteria security certifications. I have also authored 5 research papers in 2001 on biometrics based key generation for cryptography based digital signature algorithms (RSA and DSA) known as "Biometric Signatures" during my Master program including an "Information Management & Computer Security" journal paper (UK) and 2 IEEE conferences. My research on biometric signatures is one of the pioneering works in the field of biometric cryptosystems and is also the basis for today's passwordless authentication protocols like FIDO which is market worth billions of dollars and is used by companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft in their products for passkeys. It was highlighted in "Infocomm Security Technologies for E-Commerce" report published by Singapore Government in ITR4 2002 and has been cited in over 120 publications including 10 USA patents. My B-Tech final year project on embedded networking on design of microcontroller based standalone and bi-directional parallel to serial port network adapter (for interfacing computers and peripherals having SPP/EPP and Centronix printer port with devices having RS-232) and associated software executed during 1998-99 at IIT Bombay is published in Dr Dobbâ€™s Journal (one of the best Silicon Valley, USA based software magazines of its time). I am AWS certified cloud solutions architect and security specialist. Presently, I am working as Senior Security Architect with a leading IT company in India.
